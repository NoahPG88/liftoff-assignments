You will need to upload a .PDF of your resume to this repo, or connect with your mentor on an alternate way of submitting your resume.
- I don't have a current resume, but I am currently employed.  If you would like my resume from when I was hired I can send it to you, but for now I think it's reasonable to assume that my LinkedIN is my current resume.
